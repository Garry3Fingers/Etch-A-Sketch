# Etch-A-Sketch
I need to create a script that after user input drawing the grid with input's size. User will be able to make a pixel picture.

- I'll use html container and append children divs to it with dom methods.

- Then with help of the dom events I'll adjust colors of divs when mouse is hover.

- I'll need implementation of user input via popup or something else.

- In this project will be three options:
    1. Change color from white to black
    2. Change color to a completely random RGB value
    3. Each pass just add another 10% of black to color

- I need to use loops for creating the grid. Maybe array methods are too.
