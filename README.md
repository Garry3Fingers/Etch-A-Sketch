# Etch-A-Sketch
I need to create a script that after user input drawing the grid with input's size. User will be able to make a pixel picture.

- I'll use html container and append children divs to it with dom methods.

- Then with help of the dom events I'll adjust colors of divs when mouse is hover.

- I'll need implementation of user input via popup or something else.

- In this project will be three options:
    1. Change color from white to black
    2. Change color to a completely random RGB value
    3. Each pass just add another 10% of black to color

- I need to use loops for creating the grid. Maybe array methods are too.

Today evening I finished this project. Tomorrow I'll check js code for mistakes. My CSS is still simple. When I'm writing JS code, I google sometimes a lot. I don't know good or bad it.

Today I did small changes for the program. I added 'click event' to start a function, that start 'mouseenter event'. And when grid is creating, new element is appearing now. It need for describing conditions for drawing.

This is the end.
